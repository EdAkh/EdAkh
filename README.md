👋 Hi, I’m EdAkh! I am a MEP Project engineer currently undergoing a career change to become a data scientist.

👀 I am passionate about data science and I believe that data science is a powerful tool that can be used to make better decisions and solve complex problems in various industries.

🌱 In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new data science concepts and techniques, and I'm always on the lookout for interesting datasets to work with. I am currently working on projects related to machine learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

👷🏾‍♂️ Despite my background in MEP Project engineering, I am committed to pursuing a career in data science and I'm excited about the opportunities this field has to offer.

📫 If you want to connect with me or collaborate on a project, you can reach me on Kaggle at EdwAkh. Let's build something amazing together!
